# Horiseon-Reimagined

## I enhanced an existing website by implementing key refactoring strategies to boost its accessibility.

- Making the website more accessible means it's easier to use and navigate for everyone. By being more accessible our website can reach a larger audience.

- I added semantic HTML elements to give the content structure clear definition.

- When inspecting the HTML structure, I found that the elements are arranged in a logical structure.

- I examined the icon and image elements, and attached alt descriptions to the images.
